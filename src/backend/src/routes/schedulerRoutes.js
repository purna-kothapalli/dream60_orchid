 * @swagger 
 * /scheduler/midnight-reset:
 *   post:
 *     summary: Manually trigger midnight reset and creation workflow
 *     description: |
 *       Executes the complete midnight workflow that normally runs at 00:00 AM daily.
 *       
 *       **What it does:**
 *       1. Resets all daily auctions (sets isActive to false, Status to COMPLETED)
 *       2. Resets all hourly auctions (sets Status to COMPLETED for LIVE/UPCOMING ones)
 *       3. Creates new daily auction for TODAY from active master auction
 *       4. Creates all hourly auctions for TODAY (all with Status UPCOMING)
 *       
 *       **Use this endpoint to:**
 *       - Test the midnight reset workflow without waiting until midnight
 *       - Manually trigger daily auction creation for today
 *       - Reset and restart auction cycle
 *       
 *       **Important:**
 *       - Only works if there's an active master auction (isActive: true)
 *       - Will not create duplicate daily auctions for the same date
 *       - All new auctions start with UPCOMING status
